# AndroidCustomFanController
From the udacity course, nothing too exciting

- Subclass an existing view or the view class and overide methods
- Create a subclass of view to customise everything
- Overide view methods such as onDraw()
- Use invalidate() to force a draw or redraw of the view.
- Init variables always outside of onDraw()
